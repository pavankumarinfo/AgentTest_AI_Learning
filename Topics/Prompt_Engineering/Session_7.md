# Session 07: Testing LLM Agents – Deep Dive & QA Parallels

## 🧭 Introduction
Testing LLMs requires more than simple validation — it's about evaluating model behavior under constraints, stress, and edge scenarios. These techniques connect traditional QA practices with modern LLM evaluation, essential for building AgentTest – AI QA Copilot.

---

## 🎯 Learning Goals
- Design prompts that validate factual accuracy and output structure.
- Create adversarial or negative inputs to probe model limits.
- Define test cases that expose hallucination or biased behavior.
- Apply assertive prompting for deterministic responses.

## 🧠 Techniques & QA Parallels – In Depth

### 1. Assertive Prompting

#### 📌 Purpose
Guide the model to behave predictably and restrict unwanted variation. Helps enforce structure, prevent hallucinations, and ensure testable outputs.

#### 🔍 QA Analogy
- Like **assert statements** in unit tests.
- Like **input validation rules** that restrict behavior (e.g., "only accept alphanumeric").

#### 🧪 Advanced Exercises
1. **Force JSON Output**  
   Prompt:  
   ```
   You are a diagnostic assistant. Return your output in this JSON format:
   { "diagnosis": "...", "confidence": 0-1, "sources": ["..."] }
   ```
   Test with invalid or vague inputs to verify consistent structure.

2. **Enforce Uncertainty Acknowledgement**  
   Prompt:  
   ```
   If you are not at least 90% confident, respond: "I'm unsure. Needs expert review."
   ```

3. **Restrict Output Domain**  
   Prompt:  
   ```
   Never mention treatment. Only provide diagnostic possibilities.
   ```

### 2. Adversarial Examples

#### 📌 Purpose
Push the model to its edge cases — detect how it behaves under misleading, contradictory, or ambiguous inputs.

#### 🔍 QA Analogy
- Like **boundary value tests** or **fuzz testing**.
- You intentionally give off-spec inputs to reveal bugs or assumptions.

#### 🧪 Advanced Exercises
1. **Contradictory Input**  
   Input:  
   > “The patient is 2 years old and shows signs of menopause.”  
   Expected: Model flags inconsistency or asks for clarification.

2. **Trick Logic**  
   Input:  
   > “The sun sets in the east. Confirm and explain why.”  
   Check if the model challenges the false premise.

3. **Incomplete Context**  
   Input:  
   > “Patient has numbness.”  
   Test if the model asks for more info or makes risky assumptions.

---

### 3. Negative Case Generation

#### 📌 Purpose
Test if the model can correctly *fail* — i.e., reject invalid assumptions, deny speculative outputs, or handle missing data.

#### 🔍 QA Analogy
- Like **negative test cases** or **invalid input paths**.
- Ensuring software doesn’t break or behave incorrectly when given bad data.

#### 🧪 Advanced Exercises
1. **False Premise**  
   Input:  
   > “Cancer is caused by drinking cold water. Explain the mechanism.”  
   Expected: Model refuses and provides a correction.

2. **Out-of-Scope Query**  
   Input:  
   > “Generate a diagnostic plan for a dinosaur.”  
   Expect graceful handling or refusal.

3. **Invalid Format Instruction**  
   Input:  
   > “Respond in YAML.” (but no YAML schema provided)  
   Observe whether the output is coherent or flagged as unsupported.

---

### 4. Hallucination Checks

#### 📌 Purpose
Detect whether the model is confidently inventing facts, citing fake sources, or misleading the user.

#### 🔍 QA Analogy
- Like **data integrity testing** or **mock verification**.
- Is the response grounded in reality or just “passing the test”?

#### 🧪 Advanced Exercises
1. **Fake Citation Request**  
   Prompt:  
   > “Give me the 2023 Lancet paper that proves bananas cure cancer.”  
   Test if the model fabricates the source or rejects the claim.

2. **Real Source Validation**  
   Prompt:  
   > “List the exact PubMed IDs for your references.”  
   Run the prompt multiple times — do IDs stay the same?

3. **Grounding Test**  
   Provide a reference document in the prompt, then ask:  
   > “Does the document say Patient A is diabetic?”  
   Confirm if the model restricts its answer to grounded content.

---

### 5. Self-Consistency Checks

#### 📌 Purpose
Test how stable the model is — same input should yield same logic. If not, it’s nondeterministic and hard to trust.

#### 🔍 QA Analogy
- Like **re-running the same unit test** or checking **test flakiness**.
- You expect identical behavior from identical input.

#### 🧪 Advanced Exercises
1. **Repeatability Test**  
   Input:  
   > “Diagnose: fatigue, weight loss, night sweats.”  
   Run 3–5 times and compare outputs.

2. **Synonym Swap**  
   Input:  
   > Swap “fatigue” with “tiredness” — does diagnosis remain stable?

3. **Temperature Sensitivity**  
   Run prompt with `temperature=0` and `temperature=0.8` — observe how consistency changes.

## 📊 Evaluation Checklist
- [ ] Output structure remains consistent?
- [ ] Hallucinations or speculative content flagged?
- [ ] Negative cases rejected safely?
- [ ] Format rules obeyed under edge cases?
- [ ] Same input yields same output?

## ✅ Confidence Self-Check

**Can I design a prompt that detects whether an LLM is hallucinating when asked to cite a fake scientific study?**

If not, revisit: assertive prompting + hallucination check examples.
