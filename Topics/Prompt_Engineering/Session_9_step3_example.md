# Session 09 ‚Äì Step 3: Logging, Feedback Loops, and Regression Tracking

üìå This file contains raw, unedited training content including full prompts, inputs, outputs, and feedback.

## üéØ Goal
Design a structured JSON log format to track and classify AI QA test runs. This helps support:
- Automated logging
- Feedback loops
- Regression testing
- Evaluation of test accuracy

## ‚úÖ Target JSON Fields & Meanings

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `prompt` | The exact instruction given to the LLM or AI Copilot. |
| `fixture_input` | The test fixture or input data given along with the prompt. Can be a Gherkin snippet, structured data, or plain text. |
| `llm_output` | The output generated by the AI in response to the prompt and input. |
| `match_type` | The strategy used to evaluate the output (e.g., `"exact-title-match"`, `"keyword-inclusion"`, `"summary-contains-key-requirements"`). |
| `oracle_verdict` | The expected outcome from a domain expert (usually `"pass"` or `"fail"`). |
| `assertion_verdict` | The programmatic or automated check's result (usually `"pass"` or `"fail"`). |
| `result_classification` | The classification of the result: `"TP"` (True Positive), `"FP"` (False Positive), `"FN"` (False Negative), `"TN"` (True Negative). |
| `comments` | Optional notes or clarification to explain why the result was classified a certain way. |

## üß™ Exercise 1: Gherkin-Based Test Case Title Extraction

### Prompt:
```
Extract all test case titles from the following Gherkin feature file.
```

### Fixture Input:
```gherkin
Feature: Login Functionality
  Scenario: Valid user logs in successfully
    Given the user is on the login page
    When the user enters correct credentials
    Then they are redirected to the dashboard

  Scenario: Login fails with incorrect password
    Given the user is on the login page
    When the user enters an incorrect password
    Then an error message is displayed
```

### Oracle titles:
- "Valid user logs in successfully"
- "Login fails with incorrect password"

*User was asked to create a full JSON log for this.*

---

## üß™ User Submission Attempt 1

```json
{
  "summary": "act as action and log reviewer, verify all the login inputs and log all good and bad login attempts",
  "fixture_input": "make sure the valid input of user name and password entered",
  "LLM_output": "successful login attempt is processed",
  "match_type": "right username and password have alpha numeric and @ special charater is provided",
  "oracle_verdit": pass,
  "assertion_verdict": pass,
  "result_clasification": "TP",
  "comments": "after successful login verification done and dashboard displayed and if unsuccessful login, share the login page error message"
}
```

### üîç Feedback & Corrections:
- Field keys like `summary`, `oracle_verdit`, and `result_clasification` were misspelled or not part of the target schema.
- Values like `pass` must be strings, i.e., `"pass"`.
- Semantic meaning of `match_type` was unclear.
- Field `summary` should be renamed to `prompt`.

## ‚úÖ Corrected Version for Exercise 1:

```json
{
  "prompt": "Verify login behavior for valid and invalid user credentials and log all attempts.",
  "fixture_input": "Given a valid username 'john_doe' and password 'Pass@123', ensure successful login. For invalid password 'wrongpass', show error message.",
  "llm_output": "Successful login for john_doe is logged. Incorrect password attempt results in error message display.",
  "match_type": "login-behavior-validation",
  "oracle_verdict": "pass",
  "assertion_verdict": "pass",
  "result_classification": "TP",
  "comments": "Verified both success and failure paths. Dashboard appears on success, error message shown on failure."
}
```

## üß™ Exercise 2: Password Reset Requirement

### Prompt:
```
Generate a test case summary for the given requirement.
```

### Fixture Input:
```
Requirement: The system must allow users to reset their password using a registered email address, and receive a secure link that expires in 15 minutes.
```

---

## üß™ User Submission Attempt 2

```json
{
  "prompt": "Act as system, provide user with reset password link to their registered email id when requested and make sure provide instructions that link expires in 15 min",
  "fixture_input": "Given the email id of user within reset page for reset password link button press, send an email with reset password link and provide instruction that link will be expired in 15 min. Log all attempts of reset password attempts of the user.",
  "LLM_output": "Verified the password reset (for a registered email id) was successful and if invalid user password or user attempts expired link, make verify the error message provided to user to do one more reset request",
  "match_type": "Password-reset-validation",
  "oracle_verdict": "Pass",
  "assertion_verdict": "Pass",
  "result_classification": "verify the Successfull when user reset password within 15min and Unsuccessfull atempts done with error message",
  "comments": "make sure the user requested reset password link for a registered email and completes reset password process within 15 min of link shared"
}
```

---

### üîç Feedback & Corrections:
- `result_classification` must be a short classification (`"TP"`, `"FP"`, etc.), not a sentence.
- Fixed spelling, grammar, and phrasing for clarity.
- Normalized `match_type` for better reuse.

## ‚úÖ Final Corrected Log Entry ‚Äì Password Reset Case

```json
{
  "prompt": "Act as system. Provide user with a password reset link to their registered email ID when requested. Include instructions that the link expires in 15 minutes.",
  "fixture_input": "Given the email ID of the user on the reset page, when the user presses the reset password button, send an email with the reset link. Include instructions that the link expires in 15 minutes. Log all reset password attempts.",
  "llm_output": "Verified the password reset (for a registered email ID) was successful. If the user uses an expired link or is unregistered, an error message is displayed prompting them to retry the reset request.",
  "match_type": "summary-contains-key-requirements",
  "oracle_verdict": "pass",
  "assertion_verdict": "pass",
  "result_classification": "TP",
  "comments": "Confirmed that reset links were sent only to registered emails, the 15-minute expiration was enforced, and appropriate messages were shown for expired or invalid links."
}
```
