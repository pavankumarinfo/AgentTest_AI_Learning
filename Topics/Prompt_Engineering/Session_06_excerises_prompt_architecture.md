# 🧪 AI Prompt Engineering – Session 06 Exercises: Prompt-Driven Product Architectures

These exercises help you apply architectural thinking to build real AI-powered product features.

---

## ✅ Exercise 1: Design a 3-Step Prompt Chain

### 🎯 Goal:
Simulate a product workflow where each step is powered by a prompt.

### Instructions:
Choose a domain (e.g., QA, HealthTech, Cybersecurity, Freelance), then describe:

- Input at each step  
- Prompt logic for that step (classify / transform / summarize)  
- Output of the step  
- Final result after 3 steps

### Template:
```text
Step 1:
Input: ...
Prompt: ...
Output: ...

Step 2:
Input: ...
Prompt: ...
Output: ...

Step 3:
Input: ...
Prompt: ...
Output: ...
```

---

## ✅ Exercise 2: Prompt-as-Logic Module

### 🎯 Goal:
Replace a rule engine or decision logic with a single smart prompt.

### Example Use Case:
Classify incoming issues into Critical / Non-Critical based on impact, frequency, and location in codebase.

### Prompt Pattern:
```text
You are a risk classifier. Based on the input below, classify the issue into Critical or Non-Critical and explain your reasoning.

Input:
- Impact: High
- Frequency: Often
- Affected Module: Payment
```

> 🔁 Create a similar decision-making prompt based on your domain (e.g., test failure triage, freelance lead scoring, etc.)

---

## ✅ Exercise 3: Prompt-in-the-Loop Mapping

### 🎯 Goal:
Pick a tool or workflow you use and identify where a single prompt can speed up the flow.

### Example:
**Tool**: JIRA  
**Use Case**: Fill bug tickets faster  
**Prompt**: "Summarize bug from logs + UI trace into title, priority, and repro steps"

### Your Turn:
Pick your own tool (e.g., GitHub, TestRail, Email) and answer:
- Tool:
- Use Case:
- Where can a prompt improve this?

---

## ✅ Exercise 4: Multi-Format Output Design

### 🎯 Goal:
Design one prompt that outputs both:
1. A user-friendly message  
2. A structured backend format (CSV or JSON)

### Prompt Pattern:
```text
You are a freelance assistant. Given the project details below, respond with:
1. A client-facing summary
2. A structured output in JSON for tracking
```

### Your Turn:
Apply this to:
- Bug ticket
- QA test case
- Freelance onboarding
- Cyber risk report

---

## 💡 Tip:
Use these exercises as prototypes for real-world tools or portfolio projects.

## ✅ Exercise 1: Design a 3-Step Prompt Chain

### 🎯 Exercise
Simulate a 3-step product workflow where each step is powered by a prompt. Define input, prompt action, and output.

---

### 📝 Your Answer
> Act as AI prompt assistant.  
> Take a request input from the user and share the user the request converted to valid and clean prompt and share him the output.  
> As details like {purpose}{action}{expected result}{tone}{language}.  
> Continue asking similar way of details for 3 times and after 3rd time output posted, ask user whether to merge the all 3 inputs into single prompt or summary.

---

### 🌟 Appreciation
🌟 **Impressive design thinking, Pavan!**  
You clearly visualized how an assistant collects structured data, builds modular prompts, and supports reuse or merging — all hallmarks of great prompt architecture.

✅ Iterative refinement  
✅ Reusable building blocks  
✅ User-driven flow

---

### 🧠 Final Prompt Blueprint (Refined)

```text
You are an AI Prompt Design Assistant.

Step 1: Ask the user for their natural language request.  
Step 2: Deconstruct it into structured fields:
  - Purpose
  - Action
  - Expected Result
  - Tone
  - Language

Step 3: Repeat for up to 3 different requests.  
Step 4: Ask the user if they’d like to merge these into:
  - A single assistant-style meta prompt  
  - Or store each as reusable building blocks
```

🧩 **New Concepts Introduced**:
- Structured field extraction
- Multi-input merging
- Modular prompt thinking

---

## ✅ Exercise 2: Prompt-as-Logic Module

### 🎯 Exercise
Replace a business logic module with a prompt that makes a decision.

---

### 📝 Your Answer
> Act as software bug classifier and good decision maker.  
> Request input of bugs with description, modules affected, environment, release date (optional), and frequency.  
> Analyze and share a table with Impact, Frequency, Affected Module, and Notes for prioritization.

---

### 🌟 Appreciation
🔥 **Sharp and realistic, Pavan!**  
You’ve modeled a prompt that can replace decision trees used in triage. This is the essence of “Prompt-as-Logic.”

✅ Practical field selection  
✅ Triage and prioritization logic  
✅ Structured table output

---

### 🧠 Final Prompt Blueprint (Refined)

```text
You are a bug triage assistant.

Given a bug report with:
- Description
- Affected Modules
- Environment
- Release Date (optional)
- Frequency

Respond with a table:
| Impact | Frequency | Affected Modules | Notes for Prioritization |
```

🧩 **New Concepts Introduced**:
- Prompt-driven decision engine
- Risk scoring logic
- Tabular reasoning output

## ✅ Exercise 3: Prompt-in-the-Loop Mapping

### 🎯 Exercise
Pick a tool (e.g., JIRA, GitHub) and insert a useful prompt into its workflow.
