# 🧠 AI Prompt Engineering – Session 06: Prompt-Driven Product Architectures

## ✅ Learning Objectives
- Understand how prompts integrate into real product systems.
- Learn 3 architectural patterns for prompt use.
- Build multi-step pipelines with prompts as logic.
- Translate prompt output into product-ready formats.
- Understand how to design with agent frameworks like LangChain or crewAI.

## 🔁 1. Prompt Integration Patterns

| Pattern | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Prompt-in-the-Loop** | Prompt handles one step in a human or tool loop | Resume optimizer, legal formatter |
| **Prompt-as-Logic** | Prompt acts as the main decision engine | Security issue triager, rule-based generator |
| **Prompt Chains** | Sequential prompts perform multi-step workflows | Bug → Risk → Ticket → Report |

---

## ⚙️ 2. Prompt-Based Product Thinking

Prompts can be:
- Standalone modules
- Plugged into APIs
- Wrapped inside agents
- Tested like logic units

Treat prompts like mini-functions:
- Input → Prompt → Output
- Output → Used in UI, API, CSV, etc.

---

## 🧠 3. From Prompt to Product Module

**Example**: Bug Report → Risk Analysis → JIRA Ticket

1. Input: Unstructured bug report  
2. Prompt 1: Extract key fields  
3. Prompt 2: Classify risk level  
4. Prompt 3: Format for JIRA  
5. Output: Structured ticket or dashboard

---

## 🔧 4. Prompt Chain Design Blueprint

Each step in a chain should specify:
- What is the input?
- What does the prompt do? (classify / transform / format)
- What is the output?
- How is it reused?

**Example**:
```text
Step 1: Extract task summary from client description
Step 2: Rephrase into functional message
Step 3: Create CSV-ready summary for internal tools
```

## 🛠️ 5. Real-World Prompt Tools & Agent Frameworks

### Frameworks that use these patterns:
- **LangChain** – Chains, tools, agents
- **crewAI** – Roles, memory, planning
- **OpenAgents** – End-to-end workflow tools
- **AutoGen** – Multi-agent orchestration

---

## 📦 6. Output Formats for Prompts

Turn AI output into structured product data:
- JSON → for APIs and tools
- CSV / Excel → for dashboards, teams
- Markdown → for docs or reports
- UI Output → for users

---

## 📈 7. What You Now Know

You can now:
- Think in "Input → Prompt → Output → Action"
- Build prompt-driven pipelines
- Plug prompts into full product workflows
- Use prompt chains to automate reasoning
- Plan prompt logic as reusable agents/tools
