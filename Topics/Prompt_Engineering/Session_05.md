## ‚úÖ Exercise 1 ‚Äì Security QA Prompt

**Your Prompt Question**:
> Write a prompt for security engineer, by reviewing the security issues listed and share the details of this security issue and its confidence score to determine is security issue.

**Refined Prompt**:
```
You are a Security QA expert with 10+ years of experience in application security, vulnerability triage, and risk classification.

Review the following reported security issue:

{security_issue_description}

Analyze the issue based on known vulnerability patterns, severity (e.g., OWASP Top 10), context provided, and the likelihood of exploit.

Respond with the following:
1. Summary
2. Classification
3. Risk Level
4. Confidence Score
5. Suggested Next Steps
```

**Input**:
```
The login endpoint does not enforce rate limiting. A user was able to submit 500 login attempts per minute and received error messages for failed logins, indicating account validity.
```

**Output**:
```markdown
**Summary**: The login API lacks rate limiting, allowing attackers to brute-force login attempts. Error responses leak account validity.

**Classification**: Brute Force / Authentication Misconfiguration

**Risk Level**: High ‚Äì This vulnerability could allow account takeover with credential stuffing.

**Confidence Score**: 92

**Suggested Next Steps**: Escalate to Security Team for immediate mitigation. Implement rate-limiting and generic error messages.

## ‚úÖ Exercise 2 ‚Äì Test Plan Transformer

**Your Prompt Question**:
> Transform the given test plan with all the tickets of different priority and servority. classify them with different modules affected and share the summary in an json or csv file format with showing of {test name},{test case description},{priority},{severity},{module}. the severity is test case serverity (low, medium, high, and critical) and similar lines for priority.

- severity (low, medium, high, critical)  
- module  

Instructions:
- Parse and classify the test cases correctly by module.
- Derive missing priority or severity using test impact and failure effect.
- If a test affects multiple modules, list all relevant modules.
```

**Input**:
```
1. Verify login fails after 5 wrong attempts ‚Äì should lock the user. Affects auth service.
2. Test image upload fails with unsupported format ‚Äì affects media module. Medium priority.

```

**Output (CSV)**:
```csv
test_name,test_case_description,priority,severity,module
Login Lockout,Verify login fails after 5 wrong attempts,high,high,auth
Image Format Upload Error,Test image upload fails with unsupported format,medium,medium,media
