# Session 02 – Advanced Prompt Techniques

## 🎯 Goals
- Learn and apply advanced prompt styles:
  - Chain of Thought (CoT)
  - Role Prompting
  - Style Transfer

---

## 🧱 1. Chain of Thought (CoT)

Encourages the AI to reason step-by-step before answering.

**Example:**  
**Prompt:** “If a train travels 60 km in 1.5 hours, what is its speed in km/h? Show your reasoning.”  
**Output:** “Speed = Distance ÷ Time → 60 ÷ 1.5 = 40 km/h. The train's speed is 40 km/h.”

---

## 🎭 2. Role Prompting

Gives the AI a defined persona or job to shape responses.

**Example:**  
**Prompt:** “You are a cybersecurity analyst. Explain why phishing is dangerous to non-technical employees.”  
**Output:** “Phishing attacks exploit trust and lack of technical awareness...”

---

## 🎨 3. Style Transfer

Ask the AI to rephrase content in a different style, tone, or format.

**Example:**  
**Prompt:** “Rewrite this sentence in the style of a suspense novel: ‘The launch was successful, and the team celebrated.’”  
**Output:** “The countdown ended in silence—then, with a jolt of electricity, the rocket soared...”

## 🎯 Your Task (Creative Prompt Design)

Instead of using predefined exercises, the user chose to learn prompt engineering by **creating their own prompts** based on themed topics. This approach builds deeper creative skill and mastery.

### 🔧 Instructions:
For each of the three advanced prompt techniques, the user was given a topic and asked to write a prompt using that technique.

| Topic | Technique | Prompt Objective |
|-------|-----------|------------------|
| 🚀 Space Travel | Chain of Thought | Write a prompt that asks the AI to think step-by-step to solve or explain something about space travel. |
| 🛡️ Ethical Hacker | Role Prompting | Write a prompt that tells the AI to act as an ethical hacker helping a company solve a specific problem. |
| 🏺 AI in Ancient Times | Style Transfer | Write a prompt that transforms a modern AI concept into something that sounds like it came from ancient mythology or a classical text. |

This format encourages prompt-building from scratch rather than editing or copying existing patterns.
