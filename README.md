# 🤖 AgentTest – AI QA Copilot | AI Testing Expert Training Journey

Welcome to my AI learning and product-building journey!  
This repository documents my structured 2–4 week training plan to become an **AI Testing Expert** and **AI Freelancer**, transitioning from my role as a Staff SDET.

I’m building this while designing and implementing a real-world product called:

> **🧠 AgentTest: AI QA Copilot**  
> A smart AI agent that evaluates other LLM agents using prompt tests, auto-evals, guardrails, and vector search.

---

## 🎯 My Goals

- Shift my career from SDET to **AI Testing / AI QA Engineer**
- Learn all essential components of AI testing, evals, and LLM safety
- Build a full product to showcase my skills in interviews and freelance work
- Enter top-tier domains like **medical AI** or **space tech AI**
- Learn deeply through coding, testing, and applied labs (not just theory)

---

## 🛠️ My Environment

- **Editor**: VS Code  
- **Runtimes**: Python, Docker, Jupyter  
- **LLMs**: OpenAI, Local Models (Llama.cpp planned)  
- **Frameworks**: LangChain, CrewAI, Autogen, OpenAI SDK  
- **Storage**: Pinecone / Chroma (Vector DB), Neo4j (Graph DB)  
- **Testing Tools**: OpenAI Evals, Guardrails, Rebuff, custom validators

## 💡 Product Vision – AgentTest: AI QA Copilot

A testing agent that:
- ✅ Tests other AI agents or chatbots
- 🔍 Automatically evaluates prompt outputs (accuracy, hallucinations, safety)
- 🛡️ Adds guardrails (toxicity, jailbreak, harmful output filters)
- 📦 Stores prompt cases and eval results using vector DB
- 🧠 Can generate tests from user stories/specs
- 🔄 Uses async testing pipelines
- 🗣️ (Optional) Supports voice-based interactions (Whisper / TTS)

## 📁 Repository Structure
/\
├── prompts/ # All ChatGPT session prompts for structured learning \
├── topics/ # One Markdown file per concept (lesson, labs, notes) \
├── labs/ # Code labs and hands-on experiments \
├── agenttest/ # Final product code for AgentTest: AI QA Copilot \
└── README.md # You are here! 


---

## 🧩 Usage

1. Each session is a focused topic → theory + labs + `.md` log
2. Prompts are copy-pasted into ChatGPT sessions to stay consistent
3. Labs are stored in `/labs`, notes in `/topics`
4. Final product lives in `/agenttest` folder
